# Dot Files

These are my personal dot files that I use on my X200T. They are designed to be used with
suckless programs like dwm, slstatus, and slock.

## Configured Programs

### Vim

Vim is configured to be used as an IDE and general text editor. These dot files use vim plug to manage
the plugins and monokai as the color scheme
