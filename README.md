# Dot Files

These are my personal dot files that I use on my X200T. They are designed to be used with
suckless programs like dwm, slstatus, and slock.

## Configured Programs

### Vim

Vim is configured to be used as an IDE and general text editor. These dot files use vim plug to manage
the plugins and monokai as the color scheme

When you first install these files, run "PlugInstall" in vim to install all the plugins

### XBindKeys

XBindKeys is started by xinitrc and uses alsautils to make the volume up and down buttons work

### Xmodmap

Xmodmap is started by xinitrc and remaps the next/back buttons found near the arrow keys on my X200T 
to function as page up and page down buttons
